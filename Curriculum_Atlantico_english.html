        <h1>Grupo Vocal e Instrumental Atlántico</h1>

        <p>It was born in October 2010 with the aim of creating a group of mixed chamber voices with a musical profile different from that of traditional choirs, and to offer a varied and enjoyable proposal but of high musical quality.</p>

        <p>Its repertoire is nourished by the cultural diversity that exists on both shores of the ocean from which it takes its name, placing special emphasis on Spanish music. Chronologically, its musical repertoire ranges from the 15th century to the present.</p>

        <p>It obtained its recognition as a Cultural Association in 2011.</p>

        <p>In its 14 years of existence, only interrupted during 2020 due to the Covid pandemic, it has added more than 100 performances throughout Spain and Portugal, also being an active generator of musical events in Noia and nearby town halls.</p>

        <p>Currently, 15 singers participate in the choir, with the traditional format of 4 mixed voices.</p>

        <p>The group is registered in the Cultural Network of the Provincial Council of La Coruña, and is associated with the Galician Choral Federation – FECOGA.</p>

        <p>The Conductor - founder and main arranger of its repertoire is Prof. Alejandro Guillermo.</p>
